# FreakGenerator
My silly generator for Spigot 1.8.8
## Things you might know
Make sure to set the seed you want in /plugins/freakgenerator/config.yml because it has a default seed, and it would be foolish that everyone running the plugin generates the same world. Do not go above the 32-bits integer limit just to be safe.

## TODO List
Caves and ores.
## Limitations
If you go super far away from the worldâ€™s origin (like a million blocks out), inaccuracies in the terrain will become more apparent.
